<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<p>The &lt;INSERT DIRECTORATE / AGENCY NAME&gt; is committed to providing websites that are accessible to the widest possible audience.</p>
<p> This website aims to conform to Level A (and in parts, Double A) of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> version 2 (WCAG 2.0), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). </p>
<p> The website is designed to display on all commonly used Internet browsers and to work effectively with accessibility hardware and/or software. To accommodate a range of connection speeds, page sizes have been kept to a minimum. Our web pages are scalable to accommodate various common screen resolutions.</p>
<h2>Downloadable Documents</h2>
<p>This website has a limited number of documents that cannot be provided in HTML format. Also, to assist users to download and share web content, some documents are available in Portable Document Format (PDF). We have taken steps to ensure where possible that alternate formats are available, commonly Microsoft Word (DOC). To access PDF files download the free <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader">Acrobat Reader</a>.</p>
<p> For downloadable documents, an icon appears alongside the document link to indicate the file type and size.</p>
